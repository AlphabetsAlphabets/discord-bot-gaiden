title: The rooms feature, and it's benefits
---

The room feature will create a new room under your name along with the topic name. The room can be controlled by the creator, and the creator only. With the exception of admins, and the owner of the discord course. 

# Benefits of implementing the room feature
1. Total control over who is allowed to join the discussion.
The creator of the room, will be able to make the room visible to the public, or hide it making it private. The creator will also be able to invite different users to join the discussion.

2. Decrease clutter
Being able to decrease the amount of work, a mod, or admin does will be quite handy. In most servers when it gets large enough will have trouble keeping track of all the different channels. Take for example a programming discord where many, many topics can be discussed. Making over 100 text channels. For each topic is not practical at all. Therefore allowing users to create their own channels for a specific topic will be very handy.

3. More favourable to private users
There are a number of discord users who wishes to talk more with another user in the server. However, they do not accept DMs or friend requests (and you sould always respect that). So when they wish to discuss a topic between just the two of them, one of them can create a private or public room to talk in.

These are the benefits of implementing rooms as a feature. As for my discord server specifically my room has it's own sets of rules. However, these rules here may not be retained if I deem it unnecessary.

1. All rules are null and void **with exceptions**
In a room whether private or public, all the standard server rules are rendered null and void **with exceptions**. The rules that will remain intact are as follows
- Respect another's opinion. No reason to break it out into a fight or heated argument.
- No racism (obviously)
- Don't shame another person's believes (religious or otherwise), opinions and anything along those lines.
Generally rooms will **not be** actively moderated. However, a person in that room can still report you for something done in a room. All they needs are screenshots and viable proof.
