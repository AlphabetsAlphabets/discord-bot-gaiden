# Discord bot gaiden
Just a little personal project that I wanted to make. And I've always wanted to make a discord bot.

Chinese translation available on [README_CN.md](https://github.com/YJH16120/discord-bot-gaiden/blob/main/README_CN.md)

# Motivation

# Features
1. Reactive search feature
The search feature is powered by DuckDuckGo's InstantAnswerAPI. Which provides search results. My bot allows you to scroll
through the results. And you can even delete the search result message after you're finished with it.

2. Streaming audio
This feature makes gaiden into a multi purpose bot, it can serach for answers, and it can also play music. Standard features include,
audio flow control; Pausing, playing, etc.
