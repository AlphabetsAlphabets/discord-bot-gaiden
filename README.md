# Discord bot gaiden
Just a little personal project that I wanted to make. And I've always wanted to make a discord bot.

# Features
1. Reactive search feature
The search feature is powered by DuckDuckGo's InstantAnswerAPI. Which provides search results. My bot allows you to scroll
through the results. And you can even delete the search result message after you're finished with it.
